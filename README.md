# Crong
## What is this?
This is a very simple pong-style game, however future plans include powerups and other crazy features.
## How to play
### Play/download the game on itch.io [here](https://sparkwave.itch.io/crong)!
Controls:

Up/Down Arrow - Move Paddle
Mouse - Move Paddle (in mouse mode)
Left Stick - Move Paddle (in gamepad mode)
Hold Esc/Q - Exit to menu
Go into the settings to change graphics settings and control methods. More graphics settings (and bloom) available if your GPU supports Vulkan.

The Windows and Linux versions don't require an installation.

For now, all the difficulty levels are the same. The enemy does however get harder the more points you get.

## How to modify
Use Godot 4.2.2 to open the project (Mono is not required).
Note: the code is provided as-is and I take no responsibility for its lack of readability or for modified versions of it.
